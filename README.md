## Software and Platform
Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC) was the primary software through which our project was coded. We used the Python coding language, and the VADER package in Python was an add-on installed to perform sentiment analysis. Microsoft VSC was run on both Windows and MacOS software, aiding in versatility and accessibility of our project.
